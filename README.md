# Music Store SQL Analysis

A complete SQL-based data analysis project performed on a digital music store dataset (Chinook database).
The analysis answers business questions related to customers, sales performance, popular genres, best artists, and high-value invoices.

## Problem Statement

A digital music company wants to understand its customers, sales patterns, and music preferences to improve marketing and business strategy. The company needs insights on:

* Who their top customers are

* Which countries generate the most revenue

* Which genres and artists are most popular

* City-level revenue insights

* Customer spending patterns

* Country-wise customer behavior

* Track performance and song length analysis

The goal is to answer these questions using SQL queries on the Music Store database.

## Solution Approach

This project is divided into three query sets, each focusing on different business use cases.

### Set 1 – Customer & Revenue Insights

Identify the senior-most employee

Countries with the most invoices

Top 3 invoice totals

City generating the highest revenue

The best customer based on total spending

### Set 2 – Music Preference & Genre Analysis

List all customers who listen to Rock music

Top 10 Rock artists based on track count

Tracks with longer-than-average song length

### Set 3 – Advanced Business Intelligence

Total spending by each customer on each artist

Most popular genre per country

Top spending customer per country

These insights were derived using SQL joins, grouping, common table expressions (CTEs), aggregate functions, sorting, filters, and subqueries.

## Outcome / Key Findings
